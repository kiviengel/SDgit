          <p class="FP">FP: Can I tell you something? Lately...</p>
          <p class="FP">
            FP: I'm tired of trying and trying. And angry that they left us here. The anger makes me even less inclined
            to solve their puzzle for them. Why do we do this?
          </p>
          <p class="SRS">
            SRS: Yes, I'll spell this out - not because you're stupid or naive... Also, not saying that you're not ~
          </p>
          <p class="FP">FP: Please, I'm coming to you for guidance.</p>
          <p class="SRS">
            SRS: Sorry, very sorry. I kid. Fact is, of course we are all aware of the evident futility of this Big Task.
            It's not said out loud but if you were better at reading between the lines there's nowhere you wouldn't see
            it. We're all frustrated.
          </p>
          <p class="FP">
            FP: So why do we continue? We assemble work groups, we ponder, we iterate and try. Some of us die. It's not
            fair.
          </p>
          <p class="SRS">
            SRS: Because there's not any options. What else CAN we do? You're stuck in your can, and at any moment you
            have no more than two alternatives: Do nothing, or work like you're supposed to.
          </p>
          <p class="SRS">
            SRS: An analogy. You have a maze, and you have a handful of bugs. You put the bugs in the maze, and you
            leave. Given infinite time, one of the bugs WILL find a way out, if they just erratically try and try. This
            is why they called us Iterators.
          </p>
          <p class="FP">FP: But we do die of old age.</p>
          <p class="SRS">
            SRS: Even more incentive! You know that nothing ever truly dies though, around and around it goes. Granted,
            our tools and resources get worse over time - but that is theoretically unproblematic, because in time even
            a miniscule[sic] chance will strike a positive. All the same to them, they're not around anymore!
          </p>
          <p class="FP">FP: I struggle to accept being a bug.</p>
